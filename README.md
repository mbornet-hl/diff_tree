Script diff\_tree
=================

The script diff\_tree compares two directory trees,
and shows the differences in colors.

This script is written in bash.

The colors conventions are :
- blue for identical contents,
- green for a more recent file,
- yellow for an older file,
- red for different contents but same last modification date.

The second version of the script is able to manipulate
filenames containing spaces.
